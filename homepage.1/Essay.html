          <p>Those who look further into the scaffolds of modern buildings, abandoned parking garages, unsanitary sidewalks, and the prejudices of “boring” Queens, will glance towards a little market in Astoria that opens annually, colorful in nature and overflowing with scents of Filipino cuisine. A sanctuary for Filipino immigrants, a food tasting for avid food enthusiasts, a curiosity for non-Filipinos, The Manila Zoo Festival. The first time I came to this sanctuary, I was 14 years old, stuck at the crossroads between two cultures, two nations, two languages, and two identities. Was I nagpa ka amerikano or a non-English speaking person obsessed with karaoke? The longer I remained in America, a hemisphere away from the Philippines, the faster I lost the ability to talk shit about other people in Bisaya. Yet, my life wasn’t full of fast food and 4th of July celebrations either. People moved three tables away from me when I opened my baon insinuating a “shitty” stench. The chicken adobo my mom made with love, now swarmed with worms and flies, because I wanted to feast with the kids who eat gummy worms and Doritos for lunch.
</p>
          <p>Coming to this festival, I was wary of the tsks the vendors would make when I butcher the pronunciation of ‘Dinuguan.’ I then overhear people exclaiming at the delicious, juicy chicken adobo cooking right in front of them. The same meal that was laying with maggots and rats now headlined as “foods to try out at the Manila Zoo Festival.” After endlessly waiting in the line, I paid for the meal and the street vendor offered me a larger amount of meat than expected because I looked too thin. Kaon pa! I reminisce of my grandmother in the Philippines and the eye smile she would make whenever I ate a spoonful of puspas as a kid. I then pass by the vibrant murals of homages to Filipino figures and art painting the walls of this run down parking garage. Our greatest prides and aspirations as Filipino immigrants striving for the American Dream poured onto a single piece of jewelry, clothing, or artwork. Maganda! However, my hands were pulled away by this random tita asking me to line dance with her to “September” by Earth, Wind, and Fire for the millionth time. She will give you no choice but to dance the night away. Sayaw uban kanamo! As soon as I knew it, a bunch of titas were teaching me how to line dance and it was so easy to learn that 50 people tagged along. Even if it was raining, the music kept playing and they floricked around the puddles that were forming. The warm aura radiating from my fellow Filipinos and even from those who were not were forever embedded in my heart. Here I call this, Manilla Zoo Festival, my second home, a mixture of both worlds, someplace where it was okay to be myself. 
</p>
          <p>Throughout the years, constructions of “state-of-the-art condo complexes” took place, a Filipino deli selling taho around Queens closed down, replaced with a Starbucks, and more often, I see white Americans in their lululemon leggings jogging around the streets where we used to live. My parents became distracted by how tall and grand the skyscrapers were but it was an intrusion of our home, a flood. I hate to admit it but it flooded the Manila Zoo Festival as well. Those I used to greet at the market disappeared one by one and moved out of state because of high rent. New vendors started to pop up trying to appeal to the desert connoisseurs and their aesthetic, colorful feeds on Instagram. What used to be the halo-halo, a Filipino dessert with ube ice cream, ice, jelly, and rich beans, is now replaced by some store selling donuts that are Ube-flavored with edible gold sprinkled on top. I witness some foreigners vlogging about how they’re going to ingest “The weirdest Filipino cuisine at Manilla Zoo” but it’s just beef with dark sauce. Looking past this superficiality, I see five year olds playing mancala with rocks and marbles. Aunties, food critics, and broke Filipino college students alike grooving to the Electric Slide. People smile as they make efforts to prance to Tinikling, a traditional Filipino dance where there’s a beating and tapping of bamboo poles as the dancers try to step in between. A realization seeped in that the party of our Filipino heritage will never stop and this invisible string that ties us together will never be cut regardless of how many floods we are bound to experience. To the vendor who supplied me an abundant amount of chicken adobo, to the auntie that encouraged me to step out onto the dance floor, and to the Fil-Am artists that properly represented our deepest emotions, dreams, and inspirations into their artwork, nahinumdom ko nimo.
